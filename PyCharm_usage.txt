Tips:
1. Ctrl+N: navigate to a class
2. Ctrl+Space: The Code Completion feature
   Ctrl+Space twice: to complete the name of any class no matter if it was imported in the current file or not.
   
   When using Code Completion, you can accept the currently highlighted selection in the popup list with Tab key.
   Unlike accepting with the Enter key, the selected name will overwrite the rest of the name to the right of the caret. This can be 
   especially useful for replacing one method or variable name with another.
3. Alt+F7: quickly find all places where a particular class, method or variable is used in the whole project
4. Ctrl+Q (View | Quick Documentation): To quickly see the documentation for the symbol at caret
5. Ctrl+B: To navigate to the declaration of a class, method or variable used somewhere in the code. 
            You can also click the mouse on usages with the Ctrl key pressed to jump to declarations.
6. Ctrl+F12: (Navigate | File Structure), quickly navigate in the currently edited file. It shows the list of members of the current class. Select an element you want to navigate to and press the Enter key or the F4 key.
            To easily locate an item in the list, just start typing its name.
7. Shift+F6 (Refactor | Rename): rename your local variables with automatic correction of all places where they are used.
8. Double Shift: search everywhere
9. Ctrl + Shift + N: Go to file
